            Welcome to this new website! It's a work in progress... <br><br><br>

            So in this space, I can start to make some plans of how to build this out.

       

        <h3>   Web page main sub pages </h3>

        <ul>    
            <li>   Blog 1 </li>

            <li>  Articles / papers 1  </li>

            <li>  Tutoring page  </li>

            <li>  Office hour  </li>
        </ul>

       





        <h3>   Habit of decisiveness </h3>
            It seems to be the case that those who get on in life have a habit of descisiveness. <br>
            Instead of putting their implementation of ideas off until later --  After some thing which is supposed to happen first -- they just start. Because for them time is money, and good fast implementation is possibly even more money, especially when accounting for compounding of momentum. <br>
            So I must adopt this approach: <br>
            Part of me is tempted to put off the work until tomorrow morning, but since I've been up all night on a bender, its now 8:50 am, and so leaving it until the morning is actually equivalent to just starting now. <br> 
            I'm also supposed to be setting off on the bike for Laos this morning, so a start will be all that is possible. But that's alright, because after this caffination wears off, I'll probably be too tired to make any real progress with the website anyway.
